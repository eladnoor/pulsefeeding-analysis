# pulsefeeding-analysis

## Introduction
The data and MATLAB and Python code used for analysis and figure generation of E. coli pulsing/starvation project is provided here. All the MATLAB code was written in version 2015b.

## The parts
This Github is divided into eight sections:
* Part 1 - Analysis of lag time versus feeding frequency - contains all of the OD data and code used for the wild-type pulsing experiments. Code generates the following plots:
  **All OD versus time plots with linear threshold fitting 
  **Lag time versus feedrate
  **Feedrate versus linear growth rate
  **Total glucose needed for proliferation versus feedrate
  **Summary table
